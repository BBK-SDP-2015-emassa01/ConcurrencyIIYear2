Dear students, 

Please find attached the code for a simple executor as outlined in the
class the other day. As you may remember, we did this together step-by-step because many of you found it challening. 

We did not have time in the class to complete the code, but here it is. Minor additions to the code include:

- Added JavaDoc and pedagogical comments
- Added exception handling
- Added a real script to launch and use the executor
- Added a lot of println's so the execution can be followed at runtime
- Encapsulated the call to wait() in its own method for clarity. 

Hope this helps. 

Best regards, 

PS: I have also extended the code (see attached ZIP) to use a pool of
threads and to use a blocking queue. 

PS2: You will see that using a blocking queue simplifies the code
significantly compared to using naked threads, wait(), and
notify(). This is the reason why executors, blocking queues, and and the whole java.util.concurrent.* package was introduced in Java 5:
to make concurrent applications easier to create and less error-prone. It is good that you understand bare threads because that knowledge may save you some day (there is a lot of legacy Java-4 code out there!) but never use them for writing new code.
